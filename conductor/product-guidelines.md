- **Whitespace:** Use generous whitespace to create a sense of calm and clarity.
- **Typography:** Clear, legible sans-serif fonts for easy readability across devices.
- **Color Palette:** A neutral base with subtle accent colors for actions and highlights.

## Voice and Tone
- **Encouraging:** The app should feel like a helpful companion, encouraging users to capture their thoughts.
- **Direct:** Communication should be concise and easy to understand.
- **Unobtrusive:** AI features should enhance the experience without being overwhelming or intrusive.

## Design Principles
1.  **Speed First:** Every interaction should be optimized for speed. Capturing a note should be instantaneous.
2.  **User Ownership:** Data privacy and ownership are paramount. Features like WebDAV sync should be transparent and reliable.
3.  **Intelligent Simplicity:** AI features should work in the background to organize and surface content, keeping the manual organization burden low.
