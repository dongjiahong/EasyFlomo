A note-taking application (likely inspired by flomo) with AI capabilities and WebDAV synchronization.

# Product Guide

## Project Name
EasyFlomo

## Problem Statement
Users need a frictionless way to capture fleeting thoughts and insights without the overhead of complex note-taking systems. Traditional tools often lack intelligent organization or simple synchronization options that prioritize user data ownership.

## Target Audience
- Knowledge workers and researchers who need a quick way to capture thoughts.
- Students and learners looking for a lightweight tool to manage study notes.
- Casual users wanting a simple, AI-enhanced replacement for a traditional journal.

## Core Value Proposition
EasyFlomo offers a distraction-free interface for instant note capture, augmented by AI for context traceability and insight generation, all while ensuring data privacy and portability through WebDAV synchronization.

## Key Features
- **Quick Capture:** Minimalist interface for rapid note entry.
- **AI Integration:** Automated tagging, summarization, and insight generation using Gemini.
- **Activity Visualization:** Heatmaps to track note-taking habits and consistency.
- **Data Ownership:** Seamless synchronization via WebDAV to keep data under user control.
- **Review & Recall:** Tools to easily browse and revisit past notes.
- **Flow Cryopod (CAPT):** A context-aware system to "freeze" mental state during interruptions and "thaw" it back with AI-driven logic recovery.
